## Documentation

v-connection-string is part of a much larger project, vertica-nodejs. While each individual package should have its own documentation for exposing and detailing related components of the vertica-nodejs API, the main location for those using the driver can be found here:

- [vertica-nodejs](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs/tree/master/packages/vertica-nodejs)

Other packages part of the vertica-nodejs project can be found here:

- [v-pool](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs/tree/master/packages/v-pool)
- [v-protocol](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs/tree/master/packages/v-protocol)


## Establishing a TCP Connection with Connection String

The URL format for opening a TCP connection: 

```javascript 
vertica://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?configParams
```

where configParams are of the format ?parameterName=parameterValue and include other supported options outside of the required five. These config parameters will be passed through the same way as establishing a client connection with a config object. 

Username and Password should be urlencoded, but the database name should not be urlencoded.
