## Examples

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs/tree/master/examples) for sample applications showing how to use the vertica-nodejs client driver.

## Setting up for local development

1. Clone the repo
2. From your workspace root run `yarn` and then `yarn lerna bootstrap`
3. Ensure you have a Vertica instance running with 
4. Ensure you have the proper environment variables configured for connecting to the instance (`V_HOST`, `V_PORT`, `V_USER`, `V_PASSWORD`, `V_DATABASE`, `V_BACKUP_SERVER_NODE`)
5. Run `yarn test` to run all the tests, or run `yarn test` from within an individual package to only run that package's tests

If using VS Code, you can install the `Remote - Containers` extension and it will use the configuration under the `.devcontainer` folder to automatically create dev containers, including Vertica.  See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for more information on developing in containers using VS Code.  This process will complete steps 2 to 4 above.
