Non-blocking Vertica client for Node.js made with pure Javascript.

## Usage examples

### Basic Connection
```javascript
    const client = new Client()

    client.connect()
    client.query("SELECT 'success' as connection", (err, res) => {
        console.log(err || res.rows[0])
        client.end()
    })
```


## Features

- Pure JavaScript client
- Connection pooling
- Extensible JS â†” Vertica data-type coercion
- Customizable type parsing

## Data Type Parsing

Currently the client only supports type parsing for booleans, integers, and floats where integers and floats are both parsed as javascript numbers. Everything else is treated as a string in the result rows.
