First off, thank you for considering contributing to *vertica-nodejs* and helping make it even better than it is today!

This document will guide you through the contribution process. There are a number of ways you can help:

 - [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
 - [Code Contributions](#code-contributions)
 
# Bug Reports

If you find a bug, submit an [issue](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs/issues) with a complete and reproducible bug report. If the issue can't be reproduced, it will be closed. If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue.

For issues (e.g. security related issues) that are **not suitable** to be reported publicly on the GitHub issue system, report your issues to [Vertica open source team](mailto:vertica-opensrc@opentext.com) directly or file a case with Vertica support if you have a support account.

# Feature Requests

Feel free to share your ideas for how to improve *vertica-nodejs*. We’re always open to suggestions.
You can open an [issue](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs/issues)
with details describing what feature(s) you would like added or changed.

If you would like to implement the feature yourself, open an issue to ask before working on it. Once approved, please refer to the [Code Contributions](#code-contributions) section.

# Code Contributions

## Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on Github](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-nodejs) and check out your copy locally.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/vertica-nodejs.git
cd vertica-nodejs
```

Your GitHub repository **YOURUSERNAME/vertica-nodjes** will be called "origin" in
Git. You should also setup **vertica/vertica-nodejs** as an "upstream" remote.

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:vertica/vertica-nodejs.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Configure Git for the first time

Make sure git knows your [name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/ "Set commit username in Git") and [email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/ "Set commit email address in Git"):

```shell
git config --global user.name "John Smith"
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

## Step 2: Branch

Create a new branch for the work with a descriptive name:

```shell
git checkout -b my-fix-branch
```

## Step 3: Install dependencies and configure environment

Note: If using the VS Code `Remote - Containers` extension. Skip this step and see the instructions in step 4

If yarn is not already installed, install yarn: 

```shell
npm install -g yarn
```

Then we will let yarn install all the necessary dependencies for you.
From your workspace root, run: 
```shell
yarn
yarn lerna bootstrap
```


## Step 4: Get the test suite running

Each package in the *vertica-nodejs* repository comes with a test suite of its own. It’s our policy to make sure all tests pass at all times. 

Integration tests need to connect to a Vertica database to properly run, so you must have access to a Vertica database. If using VS Code, you can install the `Remote - Containers` extension and it will use the configuration under the `.devcontainer` folder to automatically create dev containers, including Vertica.  See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for more information on developing in containers using VS Code.

Spin up your Vertica database for integration tests. Once done you will need to provide the proper environment variables to run the existing test suite. See the following examples and update them to point to your running Vertica database: 

  ```shell
  # Set environment variables in linux
  $ export V_HOST=localhost
  $ export V_PORT=5433
  $ export V_USER=dbadmin
  $ export V_PASSWORD=
  $ export V_DATABASE=VMart
  $ export V_BACKUP_SERVER_NODE=10.0.0.3 (NOT REQUIRED)

  # Delete your environment variables if desired after tests
  $ unset V_PASSWORD
  ```

Example of running tests:

```bash
# Run all packages' tests using yarn from top of repository
# or 
# cd into individual packages to run just those packages' tests
yarn test
```

The Github Actions [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) committed as part of the project will automatically run test suite through different node versions.
These CI tests must pass before any PR will be considered. This CI workflow can be run on your forked repository after you enable Github Actions on your fork.

## Step 5: Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

### License Headers

Every file in this project must use the following Apache 2.0 header (with the appropriate year or years in the "[yyyy]" box; if a copyright statement from another party is already present in the code, you may add the statement on top of the existing copyright statement):

```

```

### Commits

Make some changes on your branch, then stage and commit as often as necessary:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m 'Added two more tests for #166'
```

When writing the commit message, try to describe precisely what the commit does. The commit message should be in lines of 72 chars maximum. Include the issue number `#N`, if the commit is related to an issue.

### Tests

Add appropriate tests for the bug’s or feature's behavior, run the test suite again and ensure that all tests pass. Here is the guideline for writing test:
 - Tests should be easy for any contributor to run. Contributors may not get complete access to their Vertica database, for example, they may only have a non-admin user with write privileges to a single schema, and the database may not be the latest version. We encourage tests to use only what they need and nothing more.
 - If there are requirements to the database for running a test, the test should adapt to different situations and never report a failure. For example, if a test depends on a multi-node database, it should check the number of DB nodes first, and skip itself when it connects to a single-node database.
 - Follow the in framework that is in use, using existing tests as examples. If every unit and/or integration test in a directory is using mocha, for example, then a test belonging in that directory should use mocha. Among other reasons, make expects the right test files to live in particular places and may fail if they do not. 

## Step 6: Push and Rebase

You can publish your work on GitHub just by doing:

```shell
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

When you go to your GitHub page, you will notice commits made on your local branch is pushed to the remote repository.

When upstream (vertica/vertica-nodejs) has changed, you should rebase your work. The **rebase** command creates a linear history by moving your local commits onto the tip of the upstream commits.

You can rebase your branch locally and force-push to your GitHub repository by doing:

```shell
git checkout my-fix-branch
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push -f origin my-fix-branch
```


## Step 7: Make a Pull Request

When you think your work is ready to be pulled into *vertica-nodejs*, you should create a pull request(PR) at GitHub.

A good pull request means:
 - commits with one logical change in each
 - well-formed messages for each commit
 - documentation and tests, if needed

Go to https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/vertica-nodejs and [make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to `vertica:master`. 

### Sign the CLA
Before we can accept a pull request, we first ask people to sign a Contributor License Agreement (or CLA). We ask this so that we know that contributors have the right to donate the code. You should notice a comment from **CLAassistant** on your pull request page, follow this comment to sign the CLA electronically. 

### Review
Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. If there are comments to address, apply your changes in new commits, rebase your branch and force-push to the same branch, re-run the test suite to ensure tests are still passing. We care about quality, Vertica has internal test suites to run as well, so your pull request won't be merged until all internal tests pass. In order to produce a clean commit history, our maintainers would do squash merging once your PR is approved, which means combining all commits of your PR into a single commit in the master branch.

That's it! Thank you for your code contribution!

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the upstream repository.
